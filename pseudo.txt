A[] -> 30 A of accuracy between 0.5 to 0.7
B[] -> 30 B of accuracy between 0.5 to 0.7
C[] -> 8 C of accuracy between 0.2 to 0.9


Main loop:
for each C:
    for i in 1000: 
        for j in 300: // number of questions, to change later in the next experiment
            in each question
            get random A, random B
            get A, B, C results
            compare results to see if A, B, C are correct
