C[] -> 8 C of accuracy between 0.2 to 0.9

Main loop -> Simulator class
for each C:
    for i in 1000: // in each new loop, reset the C's rating to 1800 as it is another independent experiment
        A[] -> 30 A of accuracy between 0.4 to 1.0, norm distri.
        B[] -> 30 A of accuracy between 0.4 to 1.0, norm distri.
        

        for j in 300: // custom number of questions
            in each question
            get random A, random B
            get A, B, C results
            update ratings using RatingAPI given A, B, C results


Helper Classes:
class Person: // encapsulate each Person's information
    properties:
        - type
        - id
        - rating
        - accuracy
    
    methods:
        - toString
        - int giverAnswer(int solution)
        - void updateRating(double changeInRating)

class RatingAPI: // calculate and update ratings for the given people
    properties:
        - final k = 40
        - final constant = 400
    methods:
        - double calculateChange(Person1, Person2, result1)
        - void updateRating(A, B, C,answer for each person)


*** CHANGES IN RATING LOGIC
- if A = B, all 3 are correct -> C keeps constant
- C can be inspected when A != B 
- the person compared twice will add/subtract twice, no more taking average
